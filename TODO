Broad categorization of what's left
===================================
* Search - New app.

Logistics
---------
- Courier charge (international) - We'll figure these out by comparing some invoices, these figures are already VAT and international custom charge inclusive.

_ Quotation data:
    * Sub-total - in db as quotation_cost.
    * VAT is derived from sub-total.
    * Logistics, consists of: 
	- Transportation costs (both int'l and local) for all items in the quote - in db as quotation_courier_cost.
	- 20% markup, based on sum of sub-total and transportation costs.
    * Grand-total: total of sub, VAT and logistics.
