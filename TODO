ENHANCEMENTS
============
Use the non-js lightbox to display products since our tabs now load content from the same page. Future refactoring.
Refactor info divs on sign-up and product_groups template to use #msger. The difference between info and msg is that message will slide up but info will remain.
When the user receives info that he has added items to his quote, he should be able to click the message and the names and quantity of the items should be displayed.
The auth_checker "Start by signing in ...." on each template should be an info widget.
We can make #msger's background-color dark and fontcolor white.



Use login_required decorator. Check for other useful decorators.
Product listing: products.html, quote_preview.html. Implement inheritance.
Remember to always use todict() wherever necessary.
Throw exception when user enters 0 as quantity in addquoteitem form.
Write all tests. Models, views and javascript.
Always raise Http404 meaningfully.
It won't be a bad idea to have eqsupply's exceptions e.g CannotBeZero - in the case of specifying 0 as quantity when adding quoteitem.
Would be on the lookout for more neccessities. For now, let's raise return an error json_response. We need to fail immediately, noisily and helplessly.


use generic views
make rpm
write deploy shell script. Should take an argument either local or online
