ENHANCEMENTS
============
Use the non-js lightbox to display products since our tabs now load content from the same page. Future refactoring.
Refactor info divs on sign-up and product_groups template to use #msger. The difference between info and msg is that message will slide up but info will remain.
When the user receives info that he has added items to his quote, he should be able to click the message and the names and quantity of the items should be displayed asynchronously.
We can make #msger's background-color dark and fontcolor white.
use generic views
It won't be a bad idea to have eqsupply's exceptions e.g CannotBeZero - in the case of specifying 0 as quantity when adding quoteitem. 
Would be on the lookout for more neccessities. For now, let's raise return an error json_response. We need to always fail immediately, noisily and helplessly.
Product listing: products.html, quote_preview.html. Implement inheritance.
Refactoring json_response: Will there ever be a time when we would need to use 500, Internal Server Error, It's needed for server exceptions e.g server issues, code error et al.




FINISHINGS
==========
Use login_required decorator. Check for other useful decorators.
Remember to always use todict() wherever necessary.
Write all tests. Models, views and javascript.
Always raise Http404 meaningfully.
Pricing patch.

-#msger always redisplays the previous msg if it needs to display another. We should always clear each message after displaying.
e.g if I try to perform an action and I get "Internal Server Error" this time, the next time I try it and perform it correctly, instead of displaying default message "Loading", it displays "Internal Server Error" on ajaxStart().
-Move all funny looking routes into their proper place, we need to create a products app.
-When a user signs up, normally, the insertion happens before activation email is sent. Then the user retries and there's a duplicate entry error because the record has been inserted once, how can we handle this situation?
-Why don't we display the activation message as a flash object on the login page? Just like "Create quote", activation is too small an operation to occupy one page.
-#msger is messed up, some serious check is needed on the login page.
-Lightbox effect to enter remaining fields before user's initial quote processing. For subsequent ones, no prompting for details.
-Lightbox effect for Quote Preview. Use escape key to close, don't forget pagination in the case of long quotes.
-Don't forget to eliminate ajaxPost and ajaxGet in quote.js too. We really need a products app.
