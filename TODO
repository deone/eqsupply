Broad categorization of what's left

* Computing costs.
* Outputting quotation in pdf.
* Search - New app.

Logistics
---------
- Courier charge (international) - We'll figure these out by comparing some invoices, these figures are already VAT and international custom charge inclusive.

- Courier charge (local): Should be calculated using the actual weight.
    * Should include VAT at 5%
    * Location is based on user's state field, with the exception of Abuja and Zaria.
    * Add a 20% markup on the courier charge to take care of local custom charge and any differences in the event that total dimensional weight is used, bank transfer charges and courier insurance (1% of actual product cost.)
    * For each weight above 0.5;
	- If it matches table record, fine.
	- If it doesn't, round-off to the nearest weight.

- Objects needed to output quote in pdf:
    * User,
    * Account,
    * Quotation.

_ Quotation data:
    * Sub-total - in db as quotation_cost.
    * VAT is derived from sub-total.
    * Logistics, consists of: 
	- Transportation costs (both int'l and local) for all items in the quote - in db as quotation_courier_cost.
	- 20% markup, based on sum of sub-total and transportation costs.
    * Grand-total: total of sub, VAT and logistics.

PDF
===
* Create a space after the logo in page_format() to care of issues for other pages.
* Refactor site_media/js/auth.js (in fact, all js) extensively. Pay special attention to request methods in functions.
